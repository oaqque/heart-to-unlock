This project attempts to recreate the work in [Unlock with Your Heart: Heartbeat-based Authentication on Commercial Mobile Phones](https://doi.org/10.1145/3264950) for our project in COMP6733.

We have chosen to use Contiki OS and the TI SensorTag 2650 as our chosen hardware for measuring heartbeat data through the accelerometer.
